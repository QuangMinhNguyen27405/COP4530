1. Worst-case time complexity of the reverse() function
The function reverse the order of the list. In worst-case scenario, 
the function tranverse through the whole list while removing Node elements 
from the List to temporarily save them  into the another new List, and 
then transver through the new List in the reversed order into the original
List. Since each elements is visited twice, one when in the original List 
and one in the new List. The time complexity is O(2n) -> O(n), where n is number 
the of the element of the List.

2. Time complexity of release_mem() function
The function is used to free memory from a specific MyMemoryBlock in a List. 
In worst-case scenario, the function transverse through all the elements 
in the List to find the desired block. Therefore, the time complexity of 
the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in List.
